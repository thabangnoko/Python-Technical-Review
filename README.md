# Python-Technical-Review
The objective of this technical review was to compare three data visualisation libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn and Dash. Specifically, this was done through applying them to a chosen dataset and identifying their strengths and weaknesses regarding different types of analyses.

# Dataset
The chosen dataset was given by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System going over nutrition, physical activity, and obesity rates in the US.

# Key Findings
It was found that each library was capable of visualising datasets to gain useful insights, however, for the stationary graphs, Seaborn was superior to Matplotlib. Dash is for interactive dashboards and thus has its own uses. All the strengths and weaknesses are further discussed in the attached report.
